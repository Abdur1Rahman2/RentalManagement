# RentalManagement
This application was developed using ASP.NET MVC C#, with some help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend and MS SQL was used as a database server.
This application provides functionality of managing the rented properties. It does so by maintaining list of properties, tenants, rents, invoices, maintenance and applications from tenants.
It provides the interface for user too where they can view their personal information along with their rented properties and unpaid/paid bills. They can also submit an application to landlord to get further assistance.
This application's backend was done on ASP.NET MVC C#. For the frontend, HTML CSS and JavaScript was utilized also. As for database, MS SQL was utilized efficiently.
Thankyou.
